# LowRankMatrix_ImageDenoising
Code for Image Denoising as described in A. Parekh and I.W. Selesnick, Enhanced Low-Rank Matrix Approximation, 
IEEE Signal Processing Letters, 23(4):493-497, 2015.

This repository houses the code for image denoising using enhanced low-rank matrix approximation as demonstrated in the paper above. 
Please note that the examples in the paper were generated using the code from 
Weighted Nuclear Norm Minimization with Application to Image Denoising, S. Gu et al. CVPR 2014. 
The WNNM code utilizes additional tricks to speed up the iterations. 

The code in this repository is a naive implementation for demonstration purposes only. 
For benchmarking, please use the implementation using WNNM. 
A request for the WNNM version of ELMA can be sent to ankit.parekh@nyu.edu
